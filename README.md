https://lucid.app/lucidchart/81439fa0-eb9e-4436-8cec-592bbd8fc06f/edit?viewport_loc=353%2C-785%2C2315%2C1902%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_e6390a31-17b1-4438-993d-b1724da04939

The purpose of this project was to showcase our skills with pulling data from the
Cars and Bids website by webscraping as well as pulling data from JSON files.
Our data sources are the database (carsdb) and the cars and bids website (for which the data is put in the database).
Our user interaction comes from a front-end we created using ReactJS, a framework for JavaScript.  
The output would be the showcase of all the sold cars on cars and bids. This also includes a page of analytics which consists of graphs that depict the average prices of cars over the lifespan of the website.

The API's we used is the cars and bids website, from which we webscraped all the closed auctions. We also used a JSON file for testing and checking data.
We also used SQLAlchemy to organize the data. We also used Beautiful soup to scrape the data from cars and bids.
